## Introduction ##

MendelScan is a software package for analyzing targeted, whole-exome, or whole-genome sequencing data in family studies of inherited disease. Given the variant calls for a family (VCF file) and pedigree/phenotype information, MendelScan allows you to prioritize candidate variants based upon segregation, annotation, population frequency, and gene expression information. It also enables the mapping of disease genes using two novel algorithms: rare heterozygote rule out (RHRO) and shared identity-by-descent (SIBD).
